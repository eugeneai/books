Polysystem analysis and synthesis. Application in Geography
===========================================================

This is a monograph of by father, which was published in 1997 in Russian. Now I
decided to start this translation to the English language as I need to
reference this book from my papers.

This book subject is to show the power of dialectics and dialectic
logic in application to various sciences, especially for
modeling. Some problems can be solved without any proofs just by means
of a correct interpretation of the existing dialectical
structure. This approach is similar to the explorations in Category
theories: most of structural properties are investigated on the very
abstract level, and, then, we need to obtain a correct interpretation
of the structure morphing it to our object under investigation.

I'm not a professional translator in the field of Philosophy and
Philosophic methodology, so I'll appreciate all the possible
help. That's why, I put this book under the Creative commons licence (see below).
