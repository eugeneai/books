Polysystem analysis and synthesis. Application in Geography
===========================================================

This is a monograph of by father, which was published in 1997 in Russian. Now I
decided to start this translation to the English language as I need to
reference this book from my papers.

This book subject is to show the power of dialectics and dialectic
logic in application to various sciences, especially for
modeling. Some problems can be solved without any proofs just by means
of a correct interpretation of the existing dialectical
structure. This approach is similar to the explorations in Category
theories: most of structural properties are investigated on the very
abstract level, and, then, we need to obtain a correct interpretation
of the structure morphing it to our object under investigation.

---------------

The subject of the book is to develop a general methodology of a complex object (the Earth and peculiar to it phenomena and processes) exploration from various aspects (view points), in various system projections using the polysystem methodology, that arise from the contradiction analysis logic, the notions and the laws of General Theory of Systems in an author's interpretation, as well as from nowadays mathematical paradigm of multidimension fibered spaces [bundles]. For each scientific view [projection] an axiomatic theory is being developed. The theory describes in a special system language [and in a through way] natural, economic, social structures and their changes. About 20 theoretical directions were highlighted, which reflect various aspects of geographical phenomena investigation of various scales, structuring existing knowledge and allowing to obtain new explanation to [the] facts. A short analysis of the conceptual basis is presented for the directions, used mathematical formalism and tools are introduces, the arrived conclusions are illustrates by examples.

The book could be of interest to the researchers of various scientific fields, which are interested in exploration of theoretical knowledge formation foundations and development of a system methodology for concrete problem solving [investigation].
